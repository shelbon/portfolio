# Mission and objective

The manager being a tennis coach, allowed me and another colleague to make a mobile application allowing him to record the performance of his tennis player more easily.

# Technologies Used

<ul>
  {props.technologies.map((technologie, index) => (
    <li key={index}>
      <p>{technologie}</p>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

# Tasks carried out

- All interfaces

- the logic of a match

# Review

This project allowed me to discover mobile development on android , and more specifically with C#(csharp).
